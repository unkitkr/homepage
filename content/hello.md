I've always wanted to build a confined space where I write words that makes (some) sense.
The possibility of my words or work making sense to you depends on what type of person/ mindset you bring in 
while reading about me/my essays.




**I want to ink this space writing about my interests:**
1. Working with computers in general.
2. Taking to computers. (Programing paradigms).
3. Decentralization. (I'm new to this but surely would love to explore it outside ape faces and coins/tokens).
4. Explorations. (I'm not sure how to describe this category but whatever is new to me is exploration).
5. Psychology. (A naive perspective on mental health, mostly from my experiences).
6. Product/Program management. (This is where I'm heading towards and hope to master skills).
7. Design, interaction with digital components, and exploring how we can do that better is what intrigue me.
8. Random/Misc. (Anything which comes to my mind and doesn't fit in the above categories). 



The plan I laid out above is just a plan and not an **execution**.

>Plan is not a promise and execution is not an outcome. 

Having said that, `hello world`.
